# Vision_Projects
In this repository, we have added few codes for image classification using conventional and advanced deep learning architectures. 

The experiments are performed using multiple computer vision datasets such as CIFAR-10: which is a 10 class object dataset and CIFAR-100 which is a 100 class datasets. 

Multiple CNN architectures are developed and exploratory data analysis has been performed in terms of images, intermediate CNN filters, and classification metrics. 

In another project, we have implemented the face recognition by first compressing the images through PCA and perform classification.

In the final project, we have also implemented a simple linear regression. The regression problem is different from above classification task. In the classification, one have to predict the categorical labels which are discrete values. In the regression, we have predict the real or continous values such as price of house, stock, and temperature of the day.

Note: The codes are inspired from several existing code repository
